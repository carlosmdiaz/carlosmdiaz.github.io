          I was born in the Dominican Republic and lived there for about seventeen years. I came to New 
          York when I was 17 years old; I had not finished high school when I moved to the United States, 
          and it was supposed to be my last year in high school in the Dominican Republic. I did not know 
          how to speak English, so when I began school, they made me repeat the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth 
          grades. The fact that I would have to repeat those three years kept me down for a couple of days. 
          However, I realized that the time was now, and now more than ever, I had to give my best. In three 
          years, I learned the language, graduated from high school with honors, and got into a four years 
          college. Currently, I attend CUNY Lehman College, performing the last semester of my junior year 
          and pursuing a B.S. degree in Computer Science.  Also, I work for New York Comunity Financial as an 
          IT Specialist. Finally, I am specializing in Web Development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, 
          and in Mobile Development using Android Studio and currently learning React Native.
